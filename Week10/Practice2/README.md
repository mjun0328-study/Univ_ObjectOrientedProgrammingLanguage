## Problem2

Person 클래스를 상속받는 Student, Employee와 Employee를 상속 받는 Faculty, Staff 클래스를 작성하는 문제입니다. 자세한 설명은 아래와 같습니다.

Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. A student has a class status (fresh- man, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the person’s name.

### sample run

```
Person: Peter
Student: Susan
Employee: Eva
Faculty: Frank
Staff: Shane
```
