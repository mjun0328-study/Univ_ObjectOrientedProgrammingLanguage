## Problem1

들어온 물체들을 10파운드의 제한이 있는 containers를 작게 사용하는 방법을 찾는 문제 입니다. 자세한 설명은 아래와 같습니다.

The bin packing problem is to pack the objects of various weights into containers. Assume each container can hold a maximum of 10 pounds. The program uses an algorithm that places an object into the first bin in which it would fit. Your program should prompt the user to enter the total number of objects and the weight of each object. The program displays the total number of containers needed to pack the objects and the contents of each container.

### sample run

```
Enter the number of objects: 8
Enter the weight of the objects: 4 5 7 5 2 3 5 9
Container 1 contains objects with weight : 4 5
Container 2 contains objects with weight : 7 2
Container 3 contains objects with weight : 5 3
Container 4 contains objects with weight : 5
Container 5 contains objects with weight : 9
```
